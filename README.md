# Corn Leaf Disease Classification

## Project Description
This project aims to develop a machine learning model capable of classifying diseases in corn leaves. Utilizing image processing technology and machine learning algorithms, this model can identify various disease types from images of corn leaves.

- Corn Cercospora Leaf Spot/Gray Leaf Spot
- Corn Common Rust
- Corn Healthy
- Corn Northern Leaf Blight

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The primary programming language for project development.
- **FastAPI**: A modern, fast web framework for building APIs with Python.
- **PyTorch**: A machine learning framework for training models.
- **Matplotlib**: A library for creating static, interactive, and animated visualizations in Python.
- **Requests**: To send requests to the API model.
- **Streamlit**: An open-source app framework for Machine Learning and Data Science projects.
- **Google Gemini**: LLM Model from Google, to give suggestion to users.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository to your local system.
2. Install all required dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3. Run api with `uvicorn api:app --reload` and then Run Streamlit app with `streamlit run app.py`
4. Try it!
